# HNSW Demo

## Installation on MacOS and Fedora

You may need the Python 3.11 version to run the HNSW Demo code since when you come to install </open-iris> in the requirement, you get an installation problem about it.

Please see a closed issue (https://github.com/worldcoin/open-iris/issues/10) for the Python version problem.

Note that the code is running using full resolution iris codes, each having 12,800 bits.
 
 
## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run Main.py
```
